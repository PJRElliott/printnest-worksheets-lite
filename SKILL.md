# PrintNest Worksheets — LITE (Free)

A free Claude Code Skill for educational printable PDF sellers. Generates 5 worksheet types via pure Python + ReportLab — no AI image cost.

> 💎 **40+ worksheet types in the Pro version** → https://synishida.gumroad.com/l/printnest-worksheets-pro

## Setup (one time)

```bash
pip3 install reportlab Pillow
python3 ~/.claude/skills/printnest-worksheets-lite/setup.py
```

`setup.py` asks for your brand name + Etsy shop URL once, then injects them into every generated PDF.

## Generators (5 included)

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/printnest-worksheets-lite/scripts/generate_math.py --book math_kg
python3 ~/.claude/skills/printnest-worksheets-lite/scripts/generate_alphabet.py --book alphabet_prek
python3 ~/.claude/skills/printnest-worksheets-lite/scripts/generate_sightwords.py --book sightwords
python3 ~/.claude/skills/printnest-worksheets-lite/scripts/generate_phonics_cvc.py --book phonics_cvc
python3 ~/.claude/skills/printnest-worksheets-lite/scripts/generate_cursive.py --book cursive_handwriting
```

## CVC workbook design

The CVC generator uses a print-first, monochrome worksheet system:

- Do not add worksheet headers, subtitles, divider rules, page numbers, or student-name footers.
- Use the bundled League Spartan Regular, Semibold, Bold, and ExtraBold fonts for all text.
- Keep worksheet text and rules black; use gray only for letters intended to be traced.
- Generate CVC pages at A4 size with a 0.75-inch content margin.
- Render `assets/images/portrait-page-template.png` as the full-page background before drawing content. The template controls banner, footer, and outer padding; do not draw separate header or footer elements over it.
- Keep exercise content clear of the footer artwork.

Or just ask Claude:

> "Generate an Alphabet Tracing Pre-K workbook"
